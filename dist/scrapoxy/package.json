    "description": "Scrapoxy is a super proxies manager that orchestrates all your proxies into one place, rather than spreading management across multiple scrapers. Deployed on your own infrastructure, Scrapoxy serves as a single proxy endpoint for your scrapers. It builds a pool of private proxies from your datacenter subscription, integrates them with proxy vendors, manages IP rotation and fingerprinting, and smartly routes traffic to avoid bans.",
